# Parent Scrap Book

I have been thinking about making a place to add the memories that I have had of my children, a place that I thought they might like to be shown one day. I created this so that I can get good records of the cute things that my kids do, and users will be able to do the same, so that they can show their children later in life the cute things that were done while they were growing up.


* Rails 5.1.6
* Using Paperclip and AWS S3 for images.
* Using Will_Paginate for displaying the memories
